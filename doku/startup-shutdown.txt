STARTUP

1) Plug in CHARGER (laturi). Fan starts.

2) Measure voltage at STORAGE PACK terminals. Should be between 9.75 .. 9.85 V. Adjust charger trimpot to 9.80V.

3) Connect the MAIN POWER copper bridge. Fasten both bolts properly.

4) Plug in CYCLER LOGIC. Leds blink.

5) Start testing


SHUTDOWN

1) Run
   ./shdn.sh
   All leds blink in sequence.

2) Unplug CYCLER LOGIC

3) Highly recommended: Unplug test cells. Removing either plus or minus sides is enough. Also remove sense wires.

4) Loosen one of the MAIN POWER copper bridge screws a bit. Remove another completely. Turn the copper bridge away.

5) Unplug CHARGER. Fan stops.
