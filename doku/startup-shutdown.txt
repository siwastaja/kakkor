STARTUP

1) Plug in CHARGER (laturi). Fan starts.

2) Measure voltage at STORAGE PACK (green) terminals. Should be between 9.75 .. 9.85 V. (Adjust charger trimpot to 9.80V).

3) Connect the MAIN POWER copper bridge. Fasten both bolts properly.

4) Plug in CYCLER LOGIC. Leds blink.

5) Plug in TEST CELLS. Be very careful.
 
6) Start testing


SHUTDOWN

1) Stop testing: CTRL+C, then run ./stop.sh

2) Run
   ./shdn.sh
   All leds blink in sequence.

3) Unplug CYCLER LOGIC

4) Highly recommended: Unplug test cells. Removing plus side is enough. Also remove sense wires.

5) Loosen one of the MAIN POWER copper bridge screws a bit. Remove another completely. Turn the copper bridge away.

6) Unplug CHARGER. Fan stops.
